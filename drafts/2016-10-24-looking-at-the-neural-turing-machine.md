Google DeepMind recently just updated its blog on a memory-augmented neural network
called a (*Differential Neural Computer (DNC)*)[https://deepmind.com/blog/differentiable-neural-computers/].
However, as much as I would like to dive straight into it, I realized that I was
lacking so much in the basics and hence decided to look at the *Neural Turing
Machine (NTM)* first as the design of the DNC has a flavour of the NTM.
