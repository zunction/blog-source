Paradoxes are often interesting things to read about as they twist your mind
in unexpected ways with their counter-intuitiveness and makes you think twice
before answering a question that you think you know the answer. I have
mentioned Russell's paradox in an earlier post which I did not discuss much
about. However, after listening to [Braess' paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braess%27_paradox) during my first lesson of
the semester, I just cannot resist generalizing Braess' paradox to our
everyday lives. Without further ado, let's look at Braess' paradox.


> For each point of a road network, let there be given the number of cars starting from it, and the destination of the cars. Under these conditions one wishes to estimate the distribution of traffic flow. Whether one street is preferable to another depends not only on the quality of the road, but also on the density of the flow. If every driver takes the path that looks most favorable to him, the resultant running times need not be minimal. Furthermore, it is indicated by an example that an extension of the road network may cause a redistribution of the traffic that results in longer individual running times <cite>Dietrich Braess</cite>
