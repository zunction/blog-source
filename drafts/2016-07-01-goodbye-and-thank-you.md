Slug: goodbye-and-thank-you
Author: zhangsheng

This is a post way past its due date although it is dated earlier for the intended reader. As I take my leave from my first job to purse graduate studies, I am thankful for the wonderful colleagues that I have in my 2 years 10 months at Toilet Paper. The fact that it is my first job would by construction make me more attached to the place although I do grumble a lot about my job. But thankfully, the never ending adversity present in our daily work brings about the close-knitted-ness and empathy we have for each other (although we often poke fun at each others misery). The same floor colleagues that took us almost 2 years before we got to really know them, has provided me with a sanctuary to escape and recuperate, a listening ear for me to air my grievances and an empty stomach to fill when we have surplus of food; I could never have survived the daily tribulation without you all.

I really wanted to give you all a proper reply to your notes in the card but couldn't find the time to rush it out in time before I left. Hence I'm going to use this post to get my replies back to you all.


Bryan: 从我们开始做同事到我离开的那一天，非常感谢你的陪伴。我们难兄难弟的关系，二逼的精神，我是不会忘记。而在我最低落的时候谢谢你的体谅与扶持，我才能把情绪与思想调整好。我希望你你能早日脱离苦海，找到一个比较顺心的工作， 还有早生贵子！哈哈！

Jin Xing: I would really encourage you to purse further studies if you have the interest, but must also factor in the employability after graduate studies which is a future problem.

Jun Jie: Although I might have very critical of you in my last few weeks, I guess you would know well what's best for you and I wish you all the best in your future endeavor in both your studies and your job. Let me be critical one last time: You are more than what you are, but you are the one that's making you less than what you are.

Man Chao: 二姐，饿姐。谢谢你亲手做的卡片；我会好好保存它的。
