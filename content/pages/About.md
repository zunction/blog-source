Title: About Me
Slug: about

Welcome to my page!

My name is Zhangsheng Lai (赖长盛) and I am currently a research assistant at [Singapore University of Technology and Design](http://www.sutd.edu.sg/) and will be starting my PhD studies with Shaowei Lin as my advisor in September 2016. I studied Mathematics in the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/) and would like to make use of my mathematical training to develop myself in the field of AI and also explore interesting topics like [homotopy type theory](https://homotopytypetheory.org/).
