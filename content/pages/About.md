Title: About Me
Slug: about


Welcome to my page!

My name is Zhangsheng Lai (赖长盛) and I am currently a Intern at Nvidia while
pursuing full-time PhD studies at [Singapore University of Technology and Design](http://www.sutd.edu.sg/) under the Engineering Systems and Design
pillar. I am interested in machine learning in general and also enjoy exploring
[homotopy type theory](https://homotopytypetheory.org/).
