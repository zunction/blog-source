Time really flies... It is my fourth week in SUTD and I have been learning lots doing the deep learning tutorials on [UFLDL](http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial). Although I did the Machine Learning course on Coursera by Andrew Ng, I never really got to really understand backpropagation. I'm just going say a bit about how backpropagation works and say more when I have the time to type finish.

To do backpropagation, we find

$$\delta_{j}^{(l)} \equiv \frac{\partial C}{\partial z_{j}^{(l)}}$$

which is the error of neuron $j$ in layer $l$. This is the first step to backpropagation. You would like to visit this website, [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html) as it gives a clear explanation of backpropagation. Have fun!
