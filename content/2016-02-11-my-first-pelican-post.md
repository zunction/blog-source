For the past two days, I have been trying to setup my github pages using Pelican so I can start writing about my thoughts, interests and share about things that I have learnt. It is by no means an easy feat for someone who only recently picked up the Python language, but thankfully for the references to and writeups by [Pythonic Perambulations](https://jakevdp.github.io), [Amy Hanlon](http://mathamy.com/migrating-to-github-pages-using-pelican.html) and also a [post](https://fedoramagazine.org/make-github-pages-blog-with-pelican) by Fedora Magazine, I have managed to successfully get everything set up and running although I still have some issues with Git.

This is the first time I am writing an online blog and I am rather excited to get it up and running. Although there are easier options like Wordpress, somehow the option of using Pelican and writing my posts in markdown seems more attractive to me; I'm probably weird. But I guess it's the sense of achievement (for me) when I manage to overcome a challenge as compared to doing something trivial.

I would like to end off my first post with this quote by the lecturer that taught me probability in university,

> "If not now then when?" <cite>Some probability lecturer</cite>

it is indeed so true and it's my prescription for procrastination.

Let's start.
