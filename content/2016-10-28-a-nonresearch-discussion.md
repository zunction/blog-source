Time really flies. I am almost two months into my PhD journey and it is really
challenging. I remembered how I used to take five modules in my undergraduate
days and can still somehow handle them well (not that I scored all As for them).
But now, with two graduate modules, I seem to be panting and running out of
steam. My brain has been out of practice for almost 3 years and now I'm like
requesting it to do high intensity interval training; it is inevitable that
I feel like this. One thing that I'm enjoying is the social life I have with
my classmates as I didn't really have one in my undergraduate days. Somehow,
although I'm filled up to the brim, I still want to spend that wee little bit
more time at the pantry to have small chats with my classmates, be it on our
everyday lives or some studies related stuff. The me in the past would have
probably made an excuse so as to go back to the books. I'm glad with this
change in me.

Today, I had a nonresearch discussion with my advisor which was a very rewarding
session. It made me understand that changing your point of view of a problem or
more generally a scenario can really make your problem less of a problem if
not vanish. For example, tension can occur between two people, be it friends,
colleagues and not forgetting husband and wife. When there is tension, it is
not necessarily a bad thing, it implies that you value that other party, else
there will be no tension. With this motivation, I present the 'proposition'


> "We need tension, and when there is tension, it allows us to deepen our
bonds."
<cite>my advisor</cite>

I really like how my advisor thinks about life, and I'm going to
quote him again:

> "If your employer is asks you about what you are doing, do not think of it
as he or she is trying to check on you. Instead think of it as, by telling him
or her what you are doing, they can in fact help you in overcoming the
obstacles that you encounter."
<cite>my advisor</cite>

To be able to see it from such a perspective certainly makes your life much
more happier. I'm sure there are skeptics that will sneer at such
'naive' way of thinking, but this is just simply making lemonades out of
lemons at its highest level. Lastly

> "If someone scolds you, it does not necessarily implies that you are at
fault. It simply means that the person scolding you could not contain his or
her outburst at that point of time."
<cite>my advisor</cite>

Of course, the last quote should only be used in certain scenarios, like someone
is forcing you to do something you dislike and there is no right or wrong in
your choice. So, we have to be able to not succumb to such outburst.

There's really much more I would have liked to share, but due to the amount
of learnings I obtained in that nonresearch discussion, I could only synthesis
out a partial of them to a level of accuracy that is acceptable for me.

I hope the points I shared above made some sense to you. If it didn't, maybe
you haven't experienced enough for the points to get to you or perhaps you are
right in the sense that they don't make sense.

To my advisor: If you ever chance upon this post of mine and I have actually
misinterpreted some things out of context, please inform me!

As the recess week approaches its end, I gonna go make more lemonades from
my stock of lemons!
